**Content as Code** is a partnership which develops workflows and technology to improve content re-use and maintainability.

The partnership brings together implementers contributing to projects publishing free/libre and open source content and wanting to have lightweight (post-CMS) approaches to content management that focus on the **author experience** (as well as editor and translator experience).

## Goals

To develop workflows and technology in order to **make content authoring and management benefit from software engineering collaboration best practices**.

In particular by:

 - Using **Git** for version control
 - Using **Markdown** and enhanced flavors of Markdown for authoring
 - Developing better tools focusing on **author experience**
 - Developing pathways for **content contribution and review**
 - Enabling **translation workflows**
 - Support **static website generation** and interoperability with **content management systems**
 - Enable content reuse
