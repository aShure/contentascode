## Architecture

In the below diagram the following approach is proposed:

 - Content Partners : Adhere to content guidelines in order to facilitate interoperability at the editorial level (adaptation of content to various audience - profile, region... - and learning situations - training, self-paced, mobile,...).
 - Curation Layer: A content catalogue helps to understand and coordinate where content is available and where it is missing. It will also aim at collecting feedback metrics from publication partners (aggregated and anonymized).
   - Curation Tools: Will help draw from the Content Ecosystem to generate content ready for publication (for Open Mentoring this would generate StoryPath compatible Content Packs, alongside Markdown files ready for publication on the wen and generation as a printed guide / for others it might mean importing content into a CMS)
 - Publication Layer: Will consist of the layer which presents and makes the content accessible to the Learning End User.
